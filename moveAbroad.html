      <h1>Move Abroad</h1>
      <h3>Mobile Application Case Study</h3>
      <p>UX/UI Design group project with Stephanie Shahbazi, June Muthee and Jonathan Perez.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>Adults who are considering moving abroad that are unfamiliar with the process, need a way to learn about the differences between the two cultures and the important steps involved in moving from their current country to a new one.</p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>moveAbroad is a mobile application that allows users to learn important information and gain the necessary resources needed when considering a move to a new country.</p>
    <h3>The User</h3>
    <p>Adults who are considering movinging to a new country and want more information on what it will be like to relocate.</p>
    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>The goal of this project was to create a digital solution to an everyday problem. Our group brainstormed ideas and then used dot voting to decide how to move forward with the concept of creating a mobile application that will make international travel easier.</p>
    <h3>The Process</h3>

     <p>We created a proto-persona based on our assumptions of the demographic who was most likely to need animal spay / neuter services.</p>

    <p>In this project, we interviewed 8 potential users and distributed a short survey via social media for additional insight. Our primary goal was to understand the needs of users who are moving internationally. This is what we found:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>70% of respondents said their top concern when moving to a new country is making sure they have the correct documents and visas.</li>
     <li>65% of survey respondents felt excited about moving abroad.</li>
     <li>58% of respondents have relocated to a different country.</li>
     <li>Users said that the most important information to have when moving to a different country  is cost of living, cultural differences, laws and social norms, crime/safety.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3 id="defineBB">Define</h3>

    <p>Individuals moving abroad need a better way to find information about a new country because they do not have a solid understanding of how things work there.
        During user interviews, we discovered that individuals who moved internationally were most concerned with safety and learning about cultural/social rules and laws.
        Therefore, we believe that individuals moving abroad will have a less stressful and smoother experience if they had all the related information in one place.

      <p>I contacted the owner of Georgia Animal Project, Cindy Foster, and she shared with me her need for volunteers and donors. There was no call to action for this on the current site, so we decided to focus on that moving forward. The original site had no real call to action, It was difficult for the user to get in-touch to donate, volunteer or schedule services because the site just listed phone numbers and email addresses.</p>

        <p>Our user interviews and survey gave us insights into what information international movers are looking for, we created a feature matrix to help us decide what information our application should provide to the user. Here are our findings in terms of what information the user wants:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Resources on how to obtain a travel visa.</li>
               <li>Important cultural differences.</li>
               <li>Insurance options.</li>
               <li>Crime and safety comparison.</li>
               <li>Cost of living / economic comparison and banking Resources.</li>
               <li>Salary conversion / comparison.</li>
               <li>Shipping options.</li>
           </ul>

         <p>Now that we know we were building a mobile app that would give users a snapshot of what it would take to get there, we started brainsrorming on how to build it. We built a style tile that had an some initial styles, it was enough to get started. It was time to figure out how to build something that could give the user the information that they craved. It would of course require data on every city combination that was picked by the user. It would also require an algorithm to compare the data sets and display results. Our first user flow for the application involved a results page that fanned out into links to each search result being displayed on it's own page.</p>
           <div>
            <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_userFlow1.jpg" class="caseStudyLargeImg">
          </div>
          <p>Because it required extra work, and woud cause the user to be forced to make 16 more taps, we decided to make the results page scrollable and have it contain all of the data.</p>
          <div>
           <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_userFlow2.png" class="caseStudyLargeImg">
         </div>
         <p>I sketched up a few wireframes so start thinkiong about how to organize the informarion on the screen. That inspired a site map.</p>

      <p>Here we created a storyboard that illustrates how the user might use moveAbroad.</p>

        <h3 id="prototypingBB">Prototyping</h3>
       
      
        
        <p>In figma I created a basic wireframe of the app so that we could start conducting usability tests. Here are the questions we wanted answers to: </p>
       
        <ul>
            <li>Is our initial user flow is understandable?</li>
            <li>Is the text on our buttons understandable?</li>
            <li>What do users think about giving their email address and salary?</li>
        </ul>
        <div>

            <h3 id="testingBB">Usability Testing</h3>
           
            
                <p>User insights from lo-fi usability test:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The user should create their username and password in the onboarding process. Not on the Sign Up / Sign In page.</li>
                    <li>The onboarding copy should explain why the app needs the users information.</li>
                    <li>The“city input field” on the Home page should use auto-complete instead of a drop down.</li>
                    <li>The Results page should have a sticky footer with ‘back’ and ‘profile’ page links.</li>
                   
                </ul>
                <p>We used our insights from our first usability test and the initial colors from the style guide to make a mid-fidelity prototype to run another series of tests. </p>
                <div>
                    <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_midFi_prototype.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
                  </div>
                <p>User insights from mid-fi usability test:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>User is confused by the order of sign up and sign in.</li>
                    <li>Users feel like the orange buttons look destructive, like a warning.</li>
                    <li>Users are confused by the page being called Home.</li>
                    <li>User wants a back button on the results page.</li>
                </ul>

               <p>Using these insights and our newly designed style guide I using HTML, CSS and JavaScript I coded a web based prototype. I filipped the sign up button with sign in so that the input fileds are grouped with the sign in button. We made the background blue color more muted to make it more visually appealing acessible to people with vision limitations. I changed the name of the Home page to Search because that is what the user is doing there. I added a Back button on the footer.
               </p>

                   

                   <div>

                  </div>

             
        


                <p>I conducted A/B testing on the primary menu item “The Process” to see if users wanted a drown menu instead of links to advance the page once you are there. 4 out of 6 chose the drop down menu.</p>
                <div>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>This was an interesting project, It was diffrent from all of the other case studies that I've done because I coded the third prototype with HTML. I would love to continue research and iterating on this idea. While it would be complicated to collect and organize all of the data needed for this to run, I think it's a valueable idea and many people considering moving to another country would like to see these results all in one place. If we were to do more testing and iterations We would want to add and test the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Comparison of multiple cities.</li>
                        <li>Ability to "favorite" or save searches.</li>
                        <li>Copy that makes users feel like their data is safe.</li>

                    </ul>
