    <h3>Travel App Case Study</h3>
    <p>July 2021</p>
    <p><b>My Role:</b> This was an individual project where I took the role of Product Designer, Interaction Designer, Visual Designer, UX Researcher</p>
    <p><b>Tools Used:</b> Figma, Adobe XD, InVision, Miro, Zoom, Otter.ai, Google Drive suite</p>
    <p><b>Timeline & Scope:</b> 4 week project to discover a customer need, define a solution, create a prototype to test and iterate on.</p>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>A young millennial with big travel dreams needs a way to prioritize and share the items on her bucket list in order to organize goals, connect with like-minded peers and gain inspiration for future adventures.</p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>A mobile application to create, search and share bucket list items.</p>
    <h3>The User</h3>
    <p>Young Millennials with big travel dreams who want to share and recieve travel inspiration.</p>
    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>The goal of this project was to create a new mobile application that would help travelers book their next vacation. I conducted research, descovered an opportity, then built a prototype for usability testing. This projcet started with a broad goal and required inductive reasoning to find a problem and solution. I did some initial research and found that the demographic who travels the most were Millenials between the ages of 23 and 38, so I decided to focus on this group.</p>
    <h3>The Process</h3>

     </div>
     <h3 id="empathizeBB">Empathize / User Research</h3>
     <p>I created a proto-persona based on my assumptions of the group who travels the most, Mellinials. Next I developed a research and interview plan to discover customer needs - This involved 5 customer interviews and a survey on social media. I wanted to see what motivated people to travel, how often they did it and what their process was like for planning.</p>
     <div class="-">
        <img src="images/bucketBookImages/protoPersona1.png" class="caseStudyLargeImg">
     </div>
     <p> I added all of the user insights collected through interviews to “sticky notes” in Miro. I sorted them based on the naturally occurring themes, creating this affinity diagram.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3 id="defineBB">Define</h3>
    <p>I created the Affinity Diagram to synthesize the data I gleaned from my research. I learned that the users like to be active, and have new experiences that they can share on social media. Several users mentioned wanting to cross items off of their bucket list. I learned that most users get their travel inspiration from social media, like Instagram and the servey showed that 73% of their travel was for pleasure. With these findings I created a user persona and empathy map.</p>

      </div>
        <h3 id="ideationBB">Ideation</h3>
        <p>After learning about the users needs, I used the "I like, I wish, what if" method to brainstorm features, then the "how, now, wow" method to prioritize the features.</p>

              </div>
           
            </div>
      <p>What I landed on was an app where the user can create a profile where they add items to their bucket list. Users can share goals and accomplishments with other users. Next I created a story board and user journey map.</p>

    </div>
        <h3 id="prototypingBB">Prototyping</h3>
        <p>I created a competitor analysis and found another app that is similar but didn't allow users to create lists in different categories so I moved forward with the assumption that this product can add value by allowing users to create multiple lists, with different catagories for similar goals. I created a user flow, sketched wireframes and transfered them to Figma where I created a clickable prototype.</p>

            <h3 id="testingBB">Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>I created a Guerilla Testing plan, and conducted 5 usability tests. I made an affinity diagram of the user insights and then moved the opportunities to a 2x2 matrix that compared the priority for customers and the business to help me decide what I should change.</p>
            <div class="container">

                <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">

                  </div>

                  <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg">

                  </div>

                </div>
                </div>

                <p>The results from my usability tests were clear to me. The onboarding process lacked clarity, causing confusion to users. I also needed to alter the state of some buttons when they are not useable. I followed Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines to create the next iteration.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>I started this project without any direction because I wanted to let the interviews guide the problem and solution. In the beginning, I was a bit overwhelmed with how broad the scope was and it was a challenge to draw conclusions from the data while working alone. I feel like I had a breakthrough by having a brainstorming session with a TA from my UX/UI class. She was able to help me recognize some patterns in the data that I was not able to see while working alone. This is where the idea for a bucket list app came from. <br><br>
                       

                        Through this process, I learned how valuable collaboration is. Design thinking is difficult to do alone, getting feedback from other people who have a different viewpoint than you is a necessity. While so many of the people that I interviewed had the same pain points and goals, It was not always easy to decipher what that meant. In some ways, finding the problem was more difficult than creating a solution. <br><br>
                        
                        
                        I found the usability testing to be extremely helpful, with only 5 tests I was able to see shortcomings in my design that I was able to fix in a day. I really only scratched the surface with what I learned and created here. My prototypes only covered sign up and sign in as well as onboarding, viewing the Home page and creating lists. There are many other features that need to be explored, I see a lot of potential in using this app to connect users who have the same items on their bucket list. The only way to know is to create an MVP, then continue to test and iterate. While I laid the groundwork for this idea, I would need a team to continue the process. <br><br>
