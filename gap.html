      <h3>Web Design Case Study</h3>
      <p>UX/UI Web Design project with Tshlene Bentley, Leah Schwartz, Bao Tran, and Laila Walsh.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>A budget conscious pet owner needs the ability to learn how to have their pets spayed or neutered in the most efficient and cost effective way, so they don't waste their precious time and money.</p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>A complete redesign of Georgia Animal Project’s website, with clear navigation, and a bold call-to-action to maximize conversion.</p>
    <h3>The User</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>Budget conscious pet owners who need to have their pet spayed or neutered.</li>
     <li>Enthusiastic animal lovers who want to volunteer or donate to the cause.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>The Goal of this project was to find a non-profit with a web-experience that needed a face lift, then use design thinking to create and test solutions that improve the user experience and create better outcomes for the business. My team conducted user research, interviewed the owner as well as people who have had their pet spayed or neutered in the past. This way we could move forward with empathy for everyone involved, as we made data-driven decisions on how to redesign Georgia Animal Project's website.</p>
    <h3>The Process</h3>

     <h3 id="empathizeBB">Empathize / Research</h3>
     <p>We created a proto-persona based on our assumptions of the demographic who was most likely to need animal spay / neuter services.</p>
     <div>
        <img src="GAPImages/GAP_Proto-Persona2.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
    </div>
    <p>We conducted 5 user interviews and surveyed 31 participants. As a group, using Miro and Zoom, we synthesized the data into an affinity diagram of user insights. This is what we discovered:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Users don’t want to deal with the hassle of having a pet that can reproduce, because it can be messy and lead to unwanted litters from their pet.</li>
     <li>Users want to do the responsible thing by having their pet fixed, because unwanted litters will contribute to animal overpopulation and unnecessary euthanasia.</li>
     <li>Users want to save time and money.</li>
     <li>61% of users want to have their pet spayed/neutered to reduce animal overpopulation.</li>
    </ul>

     <p>I contacted the owner of Georgia Animal Project, Cindy Foster, and she shared with me her need for donors.</p>
     <div class="blockQuoteContainer">
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
         <em>“We service rescue groups, shelters, community programs and the public at large. We would also like to continue educating the public on the importance of spay/neuter and humane care.  In addition, we need to grab the attention of potential donors.“</em> - Cindy Foster, Owner.

      <h3 id="defineBB">Define</h3>

    <p>Once we gathered any synthesized all of the data from our initial interviews and survey, we were able to create a user persona that was data-driven.</p>
    <div>
      <img src="GAPImages/GAP_userPersona1.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
    </div>
    <p>I created this Value Proposition Canvas and Empathy Map to help us get a better understanding of the user's needs and pain points as well as how they relate to the business:</p>
    <div>
      <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">
         <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg">

      </div>
    </div>

      <p>Georgia Animal Project's website had no real call to action, it was difficult for the user to get in-touch, donate, volunteer or schedule services because the site just listed phone numbers and email addresses, but had no real call-to-action so we decided to focus on that moving forward.</p>

        <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">

        <p>Our group collaborated to prioritize the features that we would like to change in order to improve GAP’s web experience. There were many opportunities, so we used dot voting through Miro and Zoom to narrow it down. The things we decided to focus on were:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Navigation / IA</li>
               <li>Drawing the user to the desired CTA</li>
               <li>Imagery and layout</li>
           </ul> 
           <p>We did a card sorting exercise on all of the site contents to come up with a solution for the new navigation, then we started drawing wireframes. We believe that if we reorganize the information, media, and navigation on Georgia Animal Project’s website, users will be able to find the information that they are looking for more easily, resulting in an increase in procedures, donations and volunteers.</p>

           </div>


            
      <p>We created a storyboard that illustrates how our user persona, Sydney, would interact with the website to solve her problem.</p>   
      <div>
        <img src="GAPImages/GAP_StoryBoard1.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
      </div>

        <h3 id="prototypingBB">Prototyping</h3>
       <p>I used Figma to create a lo-fi prototype so that we could test the new information archetecture.</p>
      
        <img src="GAPImages/GAP_lo-fiWireframe.png" class="caseStudyLargeImg">

        <p>User insights from lo-fi usability test:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users wanted to know who they are donating to, and how the money will be used.</li>
                    <li>Users want to see testimonials.</li>
                    <li>Users were confused by the wording of the menu item called “The Process.”</li>
                </ul>
        
        <p>After getting these results from our tests, we knew what to change when creating the next version. I created a few hi-fi mockups with different ideas for the navigation layout. Then we conducted a survey and found that 5 out of 6 users liked the first design, so we decided to move forward with that.</p>
        
          <img src="GAPImages/GAP_navIdeas1.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
       <p>As the conversation developed with Cindy from GAP, she shared with me that the bottleneck in their operation was access to volunteers, so we decided to add a button for this in the primary navigation. I created this style guide so that I could build a hi-fi prototype next:</p>
        <img src="GAPImages/GAP_styleGuide3.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
        
      
        
     

            <h3 id="testingBB">Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>I built this hi-fi prototype that inculded all of the changes that we felt we needed to make based on our first round of tests, as well as conversations with stakeholders. We added the Volunteer button, and we focused on testimonials, making them a part of every page to build customer trust. Then we did 5 usability tests to vaildate our changes.</p>
            <img src="GAPImages/GAP_hi-fi_prototype1.png" class="caseStudyLargeImg">
            
              <p>User insights from hi-fi usability test:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>User wants more details in the booking process.</li>
                  <li>User expects a confirmation email when tasks are completed.</li>
                  <li>User wanted a drop down menu on “The Process.”</li>
                  <li>Users wanted a simpler explanation on the “Home” page.</li>
              </ul>
              <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">
              <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg">
                <img src="GAPImages/GAP_dropDown1.png" class="caseStudySmallImg">
              </div>
                
              <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg">
                <img src="GAPImages/GAP_usabilityTesting.gif" class="caseStudySmallImg">
              </div>
  
            </div>
              
              
          
               

          

                <p>I conducted A/B testing on the primary menu item “The Process” to see if users wanted a drown menu instead of links to advance the page once you are there. 4 out of 6 chose the drop down menu so we decided to go with that. I updated all of the mockups and here is what we landed on:</p>
          
              <div class="">
                <img src="GAPImages/GAP_hi-fi_mockups.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
              </div>

              


              
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>We believe that our redesign has made it much easier for people to engage with and learn about GAP. The information is organized better and it’s more accessible. Donating, volunteering, and booking can all be done in just a few clicks. This should drastically improve engagement, increase donations, spay/neuter procedures, and volunteer signup for Georgia Animal Project. We never came up with a better title from the menu item "The Process." If we were to continue working on this project, that is something that we would like to explore.</p>
