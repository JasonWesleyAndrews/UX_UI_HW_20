      <h3>Mobile Application Case Study</h3>
      <p>UX/UI Design project with Stephanie Shahbazi, June Muthee and Jonathan Perez.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>Adults considering moving internationally who are unfamiliar with the process need a way to learn about the differences between the two countries' cultures and the important steps involved in moving from their current country to a new one.</p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>A new mobile application that allows users to learn and compare important information and gain the necessary resources needed when considering a move to a new country.</p>
    <h3>The User</h3>
    <p>Adults who are considering moving to a new country and want more information on what it will be like to relocate.</p>
    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>The goal of this project was to create a digital solution to an everyday problem. Our group brainstormed ideas and then used dot voting to decide how to move forward. We came up with the concept of creating a product that will make international travel easier. We spent 3 weeks doing research and designing a solution in the form of a web-based prototype.</p>
    <h3>The Process</h3>

     <h3 id="empathizeBB">Empathize / Research</h3>
     <p>We created a proto-persona based on our assumptions of the demographic who was most likely to need information on international relocation.</p>
     <div>
        <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_protoPersona2.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
    </div>
    <p>We interviewed 8 potential users and distributed a survey via social media to gain additional insights. Our primary goal was to understand the needs of users who are moving internationally. After we collected all of our user insights, we used Miro to create an Affinity Diagram that helped us make sense of the data. Here is what we found:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>70% of respondents said their top concern when moving to a new country is making sure they have the correct documents and visas.</li>
     <li>65% of survey respondents felt excited about moving abroad.</li>
     <li>58% have relocated to a different country in the past.</li>
     <li>Users said that the most important information to have when moving to a different country is the cost of living, cultural differences, social norms, and crime/safety information.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3 id="defineBB">Define</h3>
    <p>Based on our research findings, we created this user persona named Ava Davis:</p>
    
     <div>
        <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_persona2.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
      </div>
      <p>Here is an empathy map that we made for her, it goes a little deeper into her emotions and feelings:

      <div>
        <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_empathyMap2.jpg" class="caseStudyLargeImg">
     </div>
     <p>During user interviews, we discovered that individuals who moved internationally were most concerned with safety and learning about cultural and social rules.
      Our hypothesis was that individuals moving abroad will have a less stressful and smoother experience if they had all the related information in one place. 
      </p>

      

  
     
      
        <h3 id="ideationBB">Ideation</h3>
        <p>Our user interviews and survey gave us insights into what information international movers are looking for, we created a feature matrix to help us decide what information our application should provide to the user. Here are our findings in terms of what information the user wants:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Resources on how to obtain a travel visa.</li>
               <li>Important cultural differences.</li>
               <li>Insurance options.</li>
               <li>Crime and safety comparison.</li>
               <li>Cost of living / economic comparison and banking Resources.</li>
               <li>Salary conversion / comparison.</li>
               <li>Shipping options for large personal items.</li>
           </ul> 
           <p>The people that we interviewed said that this information would be most convenient if it were delivered through a mobile application that would give users a snapshot of what it would take to relocate to a new country. We brainstormed on how to build the app and created a style tile that had some initial styles, it was enough to get started. </p>
      

          <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">
            <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg"> 
              <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_featurePrioritization.png" class="caseStudySmallImg">
            </div>
            <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg"> 
              <img src="moveAbroadImages/UI-Style-Tile.png" class="caseStudySmallImg">
            </div>
         </div>
         <p>Now we needed to figure out how to build something that could give the user the information that they wanted. Our first user flow involved a results page that fanned out into links to each search category being displayed on it's own page.</p>
           <div>
            <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_userFlow1.jpg" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
          </div>
          <p>Because this required extra work to design, and it woud cause the user to make several unnecessary taps, we decided to make the results page scrollable and have it contain all of the information.</p>
          <div>
           <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_userFlow2.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
         </div>
         <p>I sketched up a few wireframes to start working out a way to organize the informarion on the screen. That inspired this site map:</p>

           <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">
            <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg"> 
              <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_Wireframe11.jpg" class="caseStudySmallImg">
            </div>
            <div class="caseStudyDoubleImg"> 
              <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_siteMap1.png" class="caseStudySmallImg">
            </div>
         </div>


            
      <p>We created a storyboard that illustrates how the user might use moveAbroad.</p>   
      <div>
        <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_storyBoard1.jpg" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
      </div>

        <h3 id="prototypingBB">Prototyping</h3>
       
      
        
        <p>In figma I created a basic wireframe of the app so that we could start conducting usability tests. Here are the questions that we wanted answers to: </p>
       
        <ul>
            <li>Is our initial user flow is understandable?</li>
            <li>Is the text on our buttons understandable?</li>
            <li>What do users think about giving their email address and salary?</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <img src="moveAbroadImages/wireframe1.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
          </div>
       
          <p>User insights from lo-fi usability test:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>The user should create their username and password in the onboarding process, not on the Sign Up / Sign In page.</li>
              <li>The onboarding copy should explain why the app needs the users information, some users had data privacy concerns.</li>
              <li>The “city input field” on the Home page should use auto-complete instead of a drop down.</li>
              <li>The Results page should have a sticky footer with ‘back’ and ‘profile’ page links.</li>
             
          </ul>
     

            <h3 id="testingBB">Usability Testing</h3>
           
            
                
                <p>We used the insights from our first usability test and the initial colors from the style tile to make a mid-fidelity prototype to run another series of tests. </p>
                <div>
                    <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_midFi_prototype.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
                  </div>
                <p>User insights from mid-fi usability test:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>User is confused by the order of sign up and sign in.</li>
                    <li>Users feel like the orange buttons look destructive, like a warning.</li>
                    <li>Users are confused by the page being called Home.</li>
                    <li>User wants a back button on the results page.</li>
                </ul>

               <p>Using this style guide and the results from the second usability test, I coded a web-based prototype. I filipped the sign up button with sign in so that the input fileds are grouped with the sign in button. We made the background blue color more muted to make it more visually appealing and acessible to people with vision limitations. I changed the name of the Home page to Search because that is what the user is doing there. I added a Back button on the footer.
               </p>

                   

                   <div>
                    <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_styleGuide1.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
                  </div>

             
        


                <p>The hi-fi prototype passed the final round of usability tests. All tasks were completed successfully! Here is what we came up with:</p>
                  <div>
                    <img src="moveAbroadImages/moveAbroad_hi-fi_all.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
                  </div>
                
              
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>This was an interesting project, It was diffrent from all of the other case studies that I've done because I coded the final prototype using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I would love to continue doing research and iterating on this idea. While it would be complicated to collect and organize all of the data needed for this to run, I think there is a tangible value proposition and many people considering moving to another country would like to see these results all in one place. If we were to do more testing and iterations we would want to add and test the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Comparison of multiple cities.</li>
                        <li>Ability to "favorite" or save searches.</li>
                        <li>Copy that makes users feel like their data is safe.</li>
                        <li>Moving the 'Back' button from the primary navigation to the top-left of the screen (common in iOS).</li>

                    </ul>
