      <h1>Georgia Animal Project</h1>
      <h3>Web Design Case Study</h3>
      <p>UX/UI Web Design group project with Tshlene Bentley, Leah Schwartz, Bao Tran, and Laila Walsh.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>Georgia Animal Project's website had no real call to action, it was difficult for the user to get in-touch, donate, volunteer or schedule services because the site just listed phone numbers and email addresses.</p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>A complete redesign of Georgia Animal Project’s website with clear navigation, and a bold call-to-action.</p>
    <h3>The User</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>Budget conscious pet owners who need to have their pet spayed or neutered.</li>
     <li>Enthusiastic animal lovers who want to volunteer or donate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>The Goal of this project was to find a non-profit with a web experience that needed a face lift, then use design thinking to create and test solutions to improve the user experience and create better conversion for the business. My team conducted user research, interviewed the owner as well as people who have had their pet spayed or neutered in the past, so that we could move forward with empathy for everyone involved as we makde data-driven decisions on how to redesign Georgia Animal Project's website.</p>
    <h3>The Process</h3>

     <h3 id="empathizeBB">Empathize / Research</h3>
     <p>We created a proto-persona based on our assumptions of the demographic who was most likely to need animal spay / neuter services.</p>
     <div>
        <img src="GAPImages/GAP_Proto-Persona2.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">
    </div>
    <p>We conducted 5 user interviews and surveyed 31 participants. As a group, using Miro and Zoom, we synthesized the data into an affinity diagram of user insights. This is what we discovered:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Users don’t want to deal with the hassle of having a pet that can reproduce, because it can be messy and lead to unwanted litters from their pet.</li>
     <li>Users want to do the responsible thing by having their pet fixed, because unwanted litters will contribute to animal overpopulation and unnecessary euthanasia.</li>
     <li>Users want to save money by having the procedure  done at a low cost.</li>
     <li>Users don’t want to travel far to have the procedure.</li>
     <li>61% of users want to have their pet spayed/neutered to reduce animal overpopulation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pet owners need to spay and neuter their pets to keep the animal population under control.</p>

      <p>I contacted the owner of Georgia Animal Project, Cindy Foster, and she shared with me her need for volunteers and donors. There was no call to action for this on the current site, so we decided to focus on that moving forward. The original site had no real call to action, It was difficult for the user to get in-touch to donate, volunteer or schedule services because the site just listed phone numbers and email addresses.</p>

        <p>Our group collaborated to prioritize the features that we would like to change in order to improve GAP’s web experience. There were many opportunities, so we used dot voting through Miro and Zoom to narrow it down. The things we decided to focus on were:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Navigation / IA</li>
               <li>Payment process</li>
               <li>Imagery and layout</li>
           </ul> 
            
           <div class="caseStudyThreeImgContainer">
            <div class="caseStudyStackedImgContainer">
              <img src="GAPImages/GAP_featureDotVoting.png" class="caseStudySmallImg">
              <img src="GAPImages/GAP_sitemap_cardSorting.jpeg" class="caseStudySmallImg">

            </div>
           </div>

            <p>We then did a card sorting exercise on all of the site contents to come up with a starting point for the new navigation.</p>


            
      <p>We believe that if we reorganize the information, media and navigation on Geogrgia Animal Project’s website, users will be able to find the information that they are looking for more easily, resulting in an increase in procedures, donations and voulenteers.</p>

        <p>After getting results for our tests, we created a style guide so that we could create a hi-fidelity prototype next. This is where we learned that GAP wanted voulenteers</p>

                <p>User insights from lo-fi usability test:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users wanted to know who they are donating to, and how the money will be used.</li>
                    <li>Users want to see testimonials.</li>
                    <li>Users were confused by the wording of the menu item called “The Process.”</li>
                </ul>

                <div>
                  <img src="GAPImages/GAP_navIdeas1.png" class="caseStudySmallImgNoBorder">

                <p>User insights from hi-fi usability test:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>User wants more details in the booking process.</li>
                    <li>User expects a confirmation email when tasks are completed.</li>
                    <li>User wanted a drop down menu on “The Process.”</li>
                    <li>Users wanted a simpler explanation on the “Home” page.</li>
                </ul>
               

                <div class="caseStudyDoubleImgContainer">

                </div>

                <p>I conducted A/B testing on the primary menu item “The Process” to see if users wanted a drown menu instead of links to advance the page once you are there. 4 out of 6 chose the drop down menu.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>We believe that our redesign has made it much easier for people to engage with and learn about GAP. The information is organized better and it’s more accessible. Donating, volunteering and booking can all be done in just a few clicks. This should drastically improve engagement, increase donations, spay/neuter procedures, and volunteer signup for Georgia Animal Project.
