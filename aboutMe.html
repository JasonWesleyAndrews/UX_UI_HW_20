               <p>I’m a Product Designer who has been gaining experience and studying various disciplines in tech since 2019. I have knowledge in every facet of the design process, from problem validation and prototyping, to creating high-fidelity mockups. I recently completed Georgia Tech’s UX/UI Bootcamp, received a certificate in Product Management from General Assembly and became a Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO). <br> <br>
                

I’m passionate about discovering customer needs and delivering UX solutions that address those needs, while creating value for the business. I know how important it is to make data-driven decisions and to continue to iterate on designs, because no solution is perfect. <br>
<br>

I have the soft skills to collaborate with engineers, product and other designers. I am capable of conducting UX research, conducting usability testing, and making quick sketches to articulate design decisions on the fly. I am humble, but I have a strong personality and the communication skills to help drive decisions and create alignment within a team. <br>

             <p>In my free time I love to travel and explore. I'm fascinated by building and flying RC helicopters. But my main hobby is mountaineering / rock climbing. I love the safety systems and equipment involved in completing a safe climb. I enjoy being in beautiful places, working with a partner to achieve a goal while getting a serious workout. It’s an iterative process that requires focus and it's incredibly rewarding when you make it to the top of a mountain!<br><br>
              I am musician and multi-instrumentalist; I sing, play guitar, drums, bass and keyboard. I started playing and writing music as a child and I have been a part of several bands. It has allowed me to travel all over the US, Canada and Japan to perform. This led me to get degree in Recording Arts and open a recording business.<br>

            <p>For the last sixteen years I have been the running Spotlight Sound Studio, a recording studio where I offered digital audio production services to other businesses and individuals. My studio was the number one recording studio in Alpharetta, GA for several years. In that time I gained a lot of experience working with teams, delivering high-quality work, while balancing the scope schedule and cost of the projects that I was hired to produce.<br>
              <br>
              I've been using technology, managing files, people, and projects for years. This experience gave me a curiosity for digital product management and coding, so I started reading books about the associated topics and this fueled my curiosity even more. For the last two years I have been taking classes in Front-End Development, Product Management, and UX/UI Design.<br>
