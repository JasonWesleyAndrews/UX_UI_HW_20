      <h3>UI Design Case Study</h3>

     <h3>Introduction</h3>
     <p>I did this website redesign and focused only on the user interface. I felt like there was too much going on in terms of color and the website’s UI was distracting from the true purpose; to sell trees. The red and green in the logo and navigation was not only an accessibility concern, but it also made me feel like Santa Claus was coming to town.</p>
     <div>
        <img src="bonsaiOutletImages/Old_bonsai_outlet_screen.png" class="caseStudySmallImg">
     </div>

     <h3>Header</h3>
     <p>There was a lot of wasted space in the old header and the top bar UI elements only occupied about half of the space. The red and green color scheme makes me think more of Christmas time than bonsai trees. Also, the red and green contrast is a bad choice for accessibility because people who have color blindness often can’t tell the difference between those colors. There is also no need for the contact email address to be displayed in the top of the Home page because it’s clearly on the Footer of every page.</p>
    
     <div>
      <img src="bonsaiOutletImages/Old_header.png" class="caseStudySmallImg">
   </div>
   <p>I simplified the color scheme by just using a light and dark green. The dark green became the active state in the main menu and the contrast color in the logo. I removed the contact email, collapsed the search option, and removed the top bar while adding a Specials icon. I also added a link to reviews in the bottom right.</p>
    
   <div>

  </div>
  
  <h3>Body</h3>
  <p>The old version of this site used just about every color that you can imagine. Purple, red, yellow, and blue badges to show which variety the tree is, and a slightly different blue to display a link to customer reviews. Orange stars to display customer ratings, and green primary buttons. This was very exhausting and I think it was distracting to users. The body copy has inconsistent ways of emphasizing text - In the first paragraph bold styling was used to emphasize text, and then in the third list item, it was all caps.</p>
    
  <div>
   <img src="bonsaiOutletImages/Old_body.png" class="caseStudySmallImg">
</div>
<p>I added a subtle gray background to the whole site to make the white cards pop. I removed the colorful badges and just included their information on the cards in the form of text and moved the link for reviews to the Header. With a site that will display many colorful trees, I think keeping the UI elements simple and green will help keep the focus on the products and the site UI colors will never clash with the pictures.</p>
<p>I simplified the body copy styles, only using bold to emphasize text, and I changed the hyperlink text style from blue to green to fit the page’s color scheme better. I intentionally didn’t focus on content or the overall layout, I wanted to make a big impact with subtle UI changes.</p>

<h3>Menu</h3>
  <p>The old version of the primary menu centered the menu items, and this broke the side margin rules of the rest of the site. The red background color was used to indicate menu items with a hover or active state. With a black secondary menu background.</p>
    
  <div>

</div>
<p>As mentioned earlier, I changed the menu hover states from red to dark green, I also made the secondary menu’s background color the same. I made the primary menu items adhere to the site’s margin rules and applied a “space-between” logic to them.</p>

<h3>Footer</h3>
  <p>The old version of the site used horizontal lines to separate headers and their corresponding links. The text input field for the email signup looked like a button, and there were pictures of trees in the bottom corners.</p>
    
  <div>
   <img src="bonsaiOutletImages/Old_Footer.png" class="caseStudySmallImg">
</div>
<p>I removed the horizontal lines because I felt like they separated content that is related and then arranged these link sections in two rows. I removed the icons for location and email, and made the email input field look as such. And finally I removed the trees from the bottom corners because I thought they looked tacky.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>I think this redesign is much cleaner and allows the user to focus on the product and not a rainbow of UI elements. I made subtle changes that made a huge difference. I only focused on the desktop view and did not design for mobile or tablet, that could be an entirely different case study.</p>
